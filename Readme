7-BIT HAMMING CODE GUIDE!

Simple HC Generator:
1.	It accepts 4 message bits 
2.	a parity scheme and 
3.	Provides Results in 7-bit HC.

Error Handling:
It also include an error detection and correction module which display message in both case but if there is error
Then it automatically Correct the error and also show the bit number (from right) effected.

1.	Accepts 7 bit HC
2.	Parity Scheme (Even or Odd)
3.	Generates results
